RULESET: ABSOLUTE

ARCHITECTURE
- One React component per file.  
- No composite “god components.”  
- Presentational components in /components.  
- Logic, data access, helpers in /lib.  
- No inline business logic inside JSX.  
- No layout code mixed with state management.  
- No ad-hoc utilities inside component files.
- Code must be modular. 
- Code must be made so that it is easy to change where something renders on the page. 


CODE STYLE
- Minimal imports; remove unused.  
- No dead code.  
- No commented-out blocks.  
- Enforce clear naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables.  
- No multi-purpose files; each file has one responsibility.
- Do not add edge case handling as default

STRUCTURE
- Pages under /app follow Next.js conventions only.  
- UI components cannot directly fetch data; containers or server components handle data.  
- No side effects outside dedicated hooks or server functions.  
- Keep components pure: props in, JSX out.

GENERATED CODE
- Cursor must follow these rules automatically.  
- If a request from the user contradicts these rules, follow the rules unless the user explicitly overrides.  

DIRECTORY RULES
- Every component gets its own folder under /components.
- All files related to a component (tsx, css, skeleton, tests, types) must live in that folder.
- Root /components may only contain directories, not files.
